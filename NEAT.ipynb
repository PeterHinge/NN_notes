    "### Making NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)\n",
    "\n",
    "NEAT is a genetic algorithm which as the name suggests utilizes an evolutionary approach to machine learning. In essence, it works by setting up a population of the simplest possible networks for the given task (e.g. if the task provided three inputs and expected a single output, we would create networks with 3 input neurons and 1 output neuron with no connections). The networks are then tested on the given task/problem and those who perform best according to given criteria go on to multiply and breed with one another. Thus NEAT is an unsupervised AI, although at least this particular version is not general, since we have to adjust the structure for any given problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope to make the algorithm support as many methods as possible while being as simple as possible and would appriciate any input to make this happen."

    "### Simple Neuron, Synapse and Network (for NEAT use)\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to create our NN class such that we can customize the starting parameters (inputs and outputs), while it has the capability to mutate itself. Another important feature to include is the innovation number of synapses such that we can identify similar neuron connections across networks, which allows us to divide our network population into species, thereby optimizing the crossover by identifying fit species (not only individuals). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because an individual might get lucky in one iteration but if a majority of networks with a specific connection performs well and a majority without set connection performs worse, a non-insignificant degree of belief can be attributed to the importance og this connection (especially if the networks are simple).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "As was noted in \"NN Basics\" the error margin seemed to decease by having the majority of hidden neurons in the earlier layers (simplified explanation). This principle will be implemented by placing all new neurons in the first hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have included some options in these classes that aren't yet implimented in the NEAT algorithm."
